# Soundcloud Notifier
This code uses the soundcloud library to track when new tracks are uploaded by a list of SoundCloud users, and the discord library to send a message to a Discord channel whenever a new track is uploaded. Of course, you will need to install these libraries and provide your own SoundCloud and Discord credentials in order to use this code.
